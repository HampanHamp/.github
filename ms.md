Regards HampanHamp.
**Rinmansgymnasiet "ERC" "Individuelt Alternativ" (2023 to present)** • *Education*  
Ah yes, another stop on the endless, self-inflicted educational merry-go-round. I attend, I learn, and then promptly forget most of it because I get distracted by the smallest of things, like shiny objects or, you know, existential dread. But hey, I’m still here, still pretending like I’m taking this seriously. ███, keeping my brain just a little bit more in check than it probably should be.

**Fristadsskolan (2019-2023)** • *Education*  
Ah, the time spent here could have been the moment of enlightenment... but mostly it was just me showing up, wandering aimlessly through classes, trying to avoid anything resembling actual responsibility. It was a weird, introspective time—one of "what am I doing with my life" followed by "oh, look, a video game." But enough about the wasted potential—let’s just say I was there, and it existed. ███.  

**Skogssängsskolan (2013-2019)** • *Education*  
Now, this one, this was a trip. I somehow graduated and don’t remember how. I spent most of my time there pretending to focus, pretending to be someone I wasn’t, and generally just trying to figure out why I was even in school to begin with. Turns out, the answer is that I wasn’t. But, you know, I made it out... kinda. Maybe.  ███. I won’t dox myself, thank you.

**Skogsängsskolan Legend (late 2019 to present)** • *Self-proclaimed Title*  
Ah yes, a title that I *graciously* gave myself, because, as we all know, no one else will do it for me. I’ve somehow attained the status of "legend," though no one’s bothered to verify it. But trust me, it’s real. If you don’t believe me, well, you’re obviously not one of the very few who understand my genius. So, here's to my enduring legend status. ███. It's all for me, really.

**Fristadsskolan Legend (late 2023 to present)** • *Self-proclaimed Title*  
The second legend title in the works. Same as the first, really—just a little older, a little more disillusioned. Another title that means absolutely nothing outside my own head. But hey, I get to say it, and that’s what really matters, right? Legends are made, not born, by the person who needs them the most. Again, ███. I won’t dox myself. Not today.

**Hampan Hamp (2016 to present)** • *Ceremonial Self-proclaimed Title*  
Ah, and here we are. Hampan Hamp. It’s not quite as glamorous as it sounds, because let’s face it, the title is entirely self-bestowed. But if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that *someone* needs to give me the credit I deserve, and why not be that someone? So, for all intents and purposes, consider this my very ceremonial, grandiose title—given to myself, by myself. No one else has ever called me that, and that’s the way I like it. I won’t dox myself. If you’re curious, good luck.

**Co-Founder of Halux Galaxy (2013 to present)** • *Founder of a fictional world*  
And, just in case you thought things couldn’t get more ridiculous, here we are. Halux Galaxy—a place that exists only in my mind (and maybe a few hastily written notes). I co-founded this fictional world, or at least I tell myself I did. Maybe one day it’ll be something bigger than a pipe dream. Or maybe it won’t. But it sounds cool, so I’ll claim it, because why the hell not? ███. But again, don’t bother me with specifics. I won’t dox myself.

---

There it is, all of it—my less-than-glamorous, self-proclaimed legacies of educational mediocrity and fictional glory, all carefully protected behind a shroud of ███, because honestly, I don’t trust myself with the details.
