# Brace Yourself for HampanHamp's GitHub! ðŸ‘‹

Well, hello there. Somehow youâ€™ve stumbled onto this page, so welcome, I guess. Iâ€™m Hampan Hamp, though Iâ€™m not sure why that matters. You might also recognize me as [HampanDev on Itch.io][] or maybe [HampanHamp on X][]. I made *BallGameHopp*, which is... letâ€™s just call it a shitty demo game where you is a fuckin silver ball jumpin on a silver cube that I assume some people have regrettably played. It has no other content. Most stuff I do is private. Why? Because this is my reasoning for it and basically anything:
My mind, forever mired in a ceaseless battle between grand ambition and an unyielding sense of superiority, inevitably concludes that most endeavors, at least those initiated by my own hands, fall far short of my impossibly high standards. Consequently, I'm paralyzedâ€”rendered unable to pursue much of anything for fear of producing something beneath my exaggerated sense of self-worth. In truth, I despise almost everything I create, as it fails to live up to this ridiculous ideal Iâ€™ve set for myself. And, ironically, in recognizing all this, Iâ€™m left with the rather humbling conclusion that my egoâ€™s likely the only obstacle standing in my way, and even thatâ€¦ isnâ€™t very impressive.

Oh, and heads up: I use alts. A lot of alts. Some are disclosed, and others? Undisclosed. Why? Because I hate basically everything I do, so I constantly switch things up. And yes, I fuckin swear. Deal with it.

## My Regrettable Projects
- **BallGameHopp** â€“ Honestly, itâ€™s barely a fuckin game. You jump on a silver cube as a silver ball for no reason..
- **Other Projects** â€“ Yep, there is almost never anything else since i private basically everything or use alts.
