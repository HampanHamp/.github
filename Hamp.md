Got it! Here's the version with the school names censored in the manner you've requested:

**These Titles and Achievements:**

1. ██████gsskolan Legend (late 2019 to present) • Self-proclaimed Title
   <br> My first "Legend" title, self-bestowed, of course.
   I still fuckin' know I got it.
   I screamed my name threwout the school in 2017, I think and people learned it
   When I left, for two years after, I was known by everyone.
   I was a King, and I still am a fuckin' Legend of that school.
   That’s my legacy.
   No one else cares, but I needed it.
   It’s real, I swear.
   If you don’t believe me, well, that’s on you.
   My genius, my legend. ███.
2. ██████dsskolan Legend (late 2023 to present) • Self-proclaimed Title
   <br> Got this one through a bit of a cheat, if I’m being honest.
   <br> My class and I left in grade 5 from ██████gsskolan the only grade ever leave at grade 5 at that school to ██████dsskolan Legend.
   <br> Then We came to in late 2019 for grade 6 at ██████dsskolan, but hey, still counts to have a big chunk know you I said I proclaimed it and I got it.
   <br> I did my thing, became a legend, and left my mark. The thing is, this one’s a cheat – a title built on having my class who knew join the same school as me joining it.
   <br> But hey, who needs the truth when you can have a legacy? My legend and its title is real, even if the way I got it isn’t its kinda against it in my authorized opinion. ███.











5. **██████dsskolan Legend (late 2023 to present)** • *Self-proclaimed Title*  
   The second "Legend" title, slightly newer and more jaded.  
   Means nothing to anyone but me.  
   But I get to say it, so it counts, right?  
   Legends are made, not born.  
   At least, in my head. ███.
6. **Hampan Hamp (2016 to present)** • *Ceremonial Self-proclaimed Title*  
   Ah, and here we are. Hampan Hamp. It’s not quite as glamorous as it sounds, because let’s face it, the title is entirely self-bestowed. But if there’s one thing I’ve learned, it’s that *someone* needs to give me the credit I deserve, and why not be that someone? So, for all intents and purposes, consider this my very ceremonial, grandiose title—given to myself, by myself. No one else has ever called me that, and that’s the way I like it. I won’t dox myself. If you’re curious, good luck.

7. **Co-Founder of Halux Galaxy (2013 to present)** • *Founder of a fictional world*  
   And, just in case you thought things couldn’t get more ridiculous, here we are. Halux Galaxy—a place that exists only in my mind (and maybe a few hastily written notes). I co-founded this fictional world, or at least I tell myself I did. Maybe one day it’ll be something bigger than a pipe dream. Or maybe it won’t. But it sounds cool, so I’ll claim it, because why the hell not? ███. But again, don’t bother me with specifics. I won’t dox myself.

**The Explanation:**

I won’t dox myself. I won’t subject myself to the cringy reality of revealing more about my less-than-glamorous educational past. The names are censored for a reason—because frankly, I’m too paranoid to let them slip, and also, I don’t think anyone really cares where I went. 
These schools, these titles—they’re just temporary stops in my quest to somehow justify my existence. But honestly, the biggest joke is on me. I’ve been to places, gotten some self-proclaimed titles, and called it "progress." I could tell you more, but why bother? The true irony? 
I *still* won't dox myself. Privacy is too important—though let’s be honest, I’m probably just too lazy to figure out how to.
